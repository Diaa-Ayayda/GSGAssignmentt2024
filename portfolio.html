    <section id="About">
        <h2>Abouut_Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is *Diaa Ayaydah*, and I am an electrical engineer with four years of professional experience. I
            have completed specialized training in VLSI Physical Design, where I gained expertise in floorplanning,
            placement, routing, and timing analysis using Synopsys tools. I also received certification from Bridgz,
            where I was trained for a Physical Design Junior position. In addition to my VLSI knowledge, I have hands-on
            experience in residential electrical installations and have worked on projects involving solar street lights
            and industrial control circuits, such as reverse rotation circuits for iron bending machines. I am
            continuously working to expand my skills and expertise in the field of electrical engineering.
